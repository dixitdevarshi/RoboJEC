# RoboJEC
To address the need for accessible, intelligent voice-based interactions, this paper presents RoboJec, a conversational AI platform that enables users of all age groups to engage in podcast-style discussions and personality interviews through natural conversations. RoboJec integrates Whisper ASR for high-accuracy speech recognition, Claude-3 Haiku for generating context-aware hierarchical questions, and real-time audio sentiment analysis to dynamically adapt the complexity of interactions. It employs natural language processing techniques for profession recognition, vocal engagement scoring, and structured information abstraction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate an average response time of 420 milliseconds and 95.5% question relevancy across diverse case studies. RoboJec advances the field of adaptive voice-driven AI by enabling coherent, emotionally aware, and personalized conversational experiences, thereby redefining human-AI voice interaction paradigm
